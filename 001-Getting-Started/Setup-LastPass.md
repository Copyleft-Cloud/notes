# Setup LastPass
We cannot say enough good things about this service.  

As an Engineer, you owe it to yourself to simplify your life with a password Vault.  Our practitioners have been using LastPass extensively for the past several years.  It is very convenient and secure... we highly recommend it and will be using all along the way.

## Summary
- LastPass is a password Vault
- You have a master password only you know
- You never share your master password with LastPass.
- You saved sites and credentials are bank-level encrypted in a vault.
- You can only access them with your master password.
- With LastPass you can more easily organize your credentials and manage very complex passwords for increased security.
- LastPass is Free to sign up... and has a Chrome Extension Available for ease of use.

Once you've signed up, create a folder for your organization or domain.  We'll be saving credentials along the way as we get our accounts and services set up.

This comes in very handy if you need to manage both Admin and your Individual Credentials. They do offer Enterprise (Team) Licensing... a great solution to finally sunset those excel/spreadsheet master password lists that are floating around the company ethernet.

For now, if you haven't done so already... give it a try on the freemium or premium tier for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.
