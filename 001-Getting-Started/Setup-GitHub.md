### STEP 2: Sign Up
- Pick a Username

- Create a Password (e.g. Generate Strong Password)

Don't forget to update your password vault. (e.g. LastPass!)

### STEP 3: Create New Organization
- Organization Name: <your domain or team name> (e.g. Copyleft-Cloud)
- Billing Email: <your admin email>
- Plan: Select Unlimited Members and Public Repositories for Free
- Click Create Organization

### STEP 4: Invite Team Members

### STEP 5: Create New Team

### STEP 8: Setup your Workspace on your Local Machine
On your Local Workstation… let’s create a workspace directory where we will manage our Repositories for Copyleft Cloud
```
    # Let’s Create a Main Github Directory
    mkdir Github && cd $_

    # Within that directory, let’s create a directory for our Organization
    # This is where we will keep all of our git repos associated with this Organization
    mkdir copyleft-cloud && cd $_

    # As we create git repos on GitHub this is the directory where we will clone our git repos
    pwd /Users/brian.hooper/Github/copyleft-cloud
```

## Summary
- We've created our GitHub Organization and Team
- We've invited new Team Member(s)
- We've joined and uploaded our SSH Public Key to our Profile.

As we continue, we'll be using GitHub to centrally manage the source code repositories for our team's work.  It's Infrastructure as Code... woot! woot!
