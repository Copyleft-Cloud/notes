# ChatOps
What is ChatOps? Why in the earth are we starting here?

ChatOps is a term credited to GitHub... and it is all about a conversation based collaboration model that drives development and operations (DevOps).  The ultimate
goal is focused on connecting People, Process, and Tools through automation and transparency.

We're going to start here for a few reasons.

#### Reason Number 1:  
- It is fun... flat out evil genius fun building a robot that does your bidding.

#### Reason Number 2:
- It will allow us to implement, at least initially, the start of our continuous delivery and operations pipeline that we can leverage early and build upon throughout our journey as we automate more and more aspects of our platform.

#### Reason Number 3:
- It will provide transparency and deliver an immediate feedback loop across the team which helps to build and sustain momentum.

#### Reason Number 4:
- It will challenge the team to automate repeatable tasks early and often.  We want to be good stewards of how we invest our most precious resource, time.

## Next Steps
- Creating a Hubot Project
- Deploying Hubot to a DigitalOcean Droplet
- Creating a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Travis-CI
