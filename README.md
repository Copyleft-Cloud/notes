# Copyleft Cloud Field Notes
This the collection of fields notes from our practitioners as we learn by doing.

## Summary
The best DevOps teams and cultures have their roots in open source.  

Let’s be honest, there would be no DevOps without open source… it is the ultimate incubator. As practitioners we place a high value on sharing. We share successes, what we've learned from our failures, and we share our code in a way that others can meaningfully contribute.  Copyleft Cloud is an ongoing project that documents the journey of our practitioners as we learn by doing.

This is an ongoing project to build the most kickass Cloud Platform possible using Open Source Technology and Cloud Hosted Services.

Here we will share our observations, thoughts, and source code.

## Goals
DevOps is driven in large part by the passion for minimizing risk and cost of Continual Experimentation and Learning.  Risk taking and experimentation are the primers for fueling continuous improvement.  

Our goal with Copyleft Cloud is to use Open Source Technology to implement environments for Operations (OPS) and Execution (DEV, TST, PRD) where continual experimentation and learning is available in the most efficient manner possible.

We desire to create a platform allows us to build impressive and sustainable momentum... focused on low cost, low friction, and highly efficient solutions that deliver...
- (1) Flexibility
- (2) Scalability
- (3) Speed

## Additional Thoughts
There is no silver bullet or single DevOps tool… it is rather a chain of tools that creates value and/or solves problems in various domains.

The space of DevOps moves really fast… and for our experienced Practitioners we need an Platform that can keep up with our own demands as well as our customers for exploring and implementing new services which add value and move us forward.



Throughout this journey we'll be working with a variety of Open Source Technologies and Tools, as well as Cloud Hosted Services.  

Just like many startups and lean organizations... time and money are extremely valuable resources. Our practitioners are committed to doing our absolute best to be good stewards of both.

Let's roll up our sleeves and get started!

Cheers,
Brian Hooper @ Copyleft.io
